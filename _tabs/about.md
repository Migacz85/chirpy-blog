## Introduction

Hey there! 👋 My name is Marcin, and I'm a tech enthusiast who loves to play with various technologies. I'm always curious about how things work and enjoy diving deep into coding using different web languages. But you know what? My absolute favorite pick is **Python**! 🐍 It's such a versatile language that allows me to bring my ideas to life.

## Background

I have extensive knowledge and experience in coding websites, but you know what caught my attention even more? Configuring servers! 🖥️ It's like unraveling the mysteries of the digital world. To expand my expertise in this area, I even studied materials from **CompTIA Network+** and **CySA+**. They took my understanding of server configurations to a whole new level!

## Education

In 2013, I proudly acquired a **Master's Degree in Computer Science**. It was an exciting journey, but my thirst for knowledge didn't stop there! In 2023, I completed my second Bachelor's degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at CCT College Dublin. 🤖 During my AI studies, I got to explore the fascinating realm of Machine Learning and learned how to wield a variety of ML models in practical applications.

## Tech Stack

I consider myself an individual who understands how different technologies stack up, from the lowest OSI layers to the most advanced application layers. It's like navigating through a maze of interconnected awesomeness! 🧩

But you know what? Even after understanding all that, I'm still not satisfied. I'm constantly fueled by curiosity and strive to expand my knowledge further. The tech world is ever-evolving, and I'm always up for new challenges and exciting discoveries.

Let's embark on this thrilling journey together! Feel free to reach out if you want to geek out over tech or have a good laugh. 😄✨
